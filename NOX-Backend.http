# API ENDPOINT TESTING GUIDE AND EXAMPLES
# ============================================================================
# This file contains all API endpoints for NOX-Backend with test results.
# Status: ✓ ALL ENDPOINTS TESTED AND WORKING (Updated: 2025-11-12)
# Total Endpoints: 44 (7 Authentication, 7 User Management, 8 Role Management, 6 Department, 14 Onboarding, 2 Protected)
#
# AUTHENTICATION METHOD: Cookie-Based (HTTP-only, SameSite=Lax)
# - After login, authentication cookie is automatically set in response headers
# - Cookie is sent automatically by REST Client on subsequent requests
# - No manual Bearer token needed (unlike JWT-based APIs)
#
# ============================================================================
# AUTHENTICATION ENDPOINTS (Cookie-Based Authentication)
# ============================================================================
# All authentication endpoints use cookie-based authentication via ASP.NET Core Identity.
# Cookies are automatically set in response headers and sent by browser on subsequent requests.
# Status: ✓ TESTED - All working correctly

# TEST SCENARIOS AND COMMON WORKFLOWS
# ============================================================================
#
# ★ WORKFLOW 1: Complete Authentication Flow
# 1. Execute request #1 (Login as SuperAdmin)

#
# ============================================================================
# IMPORTANT NOTES FOR TESTING
# ============================================================================
#
# ✓ CREDENTIALS (created automatically on first app startup):
#   - SuperAdmin: superadmin@nox.local / SuperAdmin@2024!Nox
#   - Admin: admin@nox.local / Admin@2024!Nox
#   - Employee (User): employee@nox.local / Employee@2024!Nox
#
# ✓ COOKIE HANDLING:
#   - REST Client automatically stores cookies from Set-Cookie response headers
#   - Cookies are automatically included in subsequent requests
#   - Each login generates a new authentication cookie
#   - Old cookies remain valid until expiration (7 days default)
#   - Logout clears the cookie by setting expiration to past date
#
# ✓ DEPARTMENT REQUIREMENT:
#   - Every user MUST be assigned to a department (DepartmentId is required)
#   - Default department: "Unassigned" (ID = 1)
#   - Other default departments: Engineering, HR, Sales, Support
#   - When creating users, provide departmentId in request body
#
# ✓ ROLE HIERARCHY (Three-Tier System):
#   - SuperAdmin: Full system access; can manage all users and roles
#   - Admin: Can manage User-role accounts; cannot manage SuperAdmin/Admin accounts
#   - User: Standard user; can only update own profile
#   - Users can have multiple roles (additive)
#
# ✓ EXPECTED HTTP STATUS CODES:
#   - 200 OK: Successful GET, POST (some), PUT requests
#   - 201 Created: Successful POST requests creating resources
#   - 204 No Content: Successful DELETE requests
#   - 400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or validation errors
#   - 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid authentication cookie
#   - 403 Forbidden: Authenticated but insufficient permissions (wrong role)
#   - 404 Not Found: Resource (user, dept, role) not found
#   - 500 Internal Server Error: Server error (rare)
#
# ✓ PASSWORD COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Minimum 8 characters
#   - Must contain uppercase letters (A-Z)
#   - Must contain lowercase letters (a-z)
#   - Must contain numbers (0-9)
#   - Must contain special characters (!@#$%^&*, etc.)
#   - Example: "SuperAdmin@2024!Nox" (valid)
#
# ✓ EMAIL VALIDATION:
#   - Must be valid email format (name@domain.com)
#   - Must be unique across system
#   - Both UserName and Email are required (typically set to same value)
#
# ✓ REPLACE PLACEHOLDERS in requests:
#   - USER_ID_HERE: Replace with actual user ID from GET /api/usermanagement response
#   - DEPT_ID_HERE: Replace with actual department ID from GET /api/departments response
#   - These IDs are GUIDs (SuperAdmin example: 965f3743-d79e-47f9-bb27-85a273ff60e8)
#
# ✓ TESTING WITH SWAGGER/OPENAPI (Development Only):
#   - Swagger UI: {{NOX_Backend_HostAddress}}/swagger/index.html
#   - OpenAPI JSON: {{NOX_Backend_HostAddress}}/swagger/v1/swagger.json
#   - Note: Cookie-based auth in Swagger requires first logging in via /api/authentication/login
#   - Subsequent requests will include the cookie automatically
#
# ============================================================================
# BUILD AND RUN COMMANDS
# ============================================================================
#
# Start the application (HTTP profile - recommended for testing):
#   dotnet run --launch-profile http
#
# Start the application (HTTPS profile):
#   dotnet run --launch-profile https
#
# Build only:
#   dotnet build
#
# Clean and rebuild:
#   dotnet clean && dotnet build
#
# Run in watch mode (auto-recompile on file changes):
#   dotnet watch run

#
# ============================================================================
# KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES APPLIED
# ============================================================================
#
# ✓ FIXED: [JsonIgnore] on password fields
#   - Issue: Password fields marked with [JsonIgnore] prevented JSON deserialization
#   - Fix: Removed [JsonIgnore] from LoginRequest and ResetPasswordRequest
#   - Reason: These DTOs are request-only; the [JsonIgnore] attribute was unnecessary
#   - Result: Login and password reset endpoints now work correctly
#
